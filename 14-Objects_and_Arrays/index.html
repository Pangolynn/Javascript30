    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // strings/nums/bools will copy the value, so you can safely change
    // a new variable that was assigned to another variable, and it won't
    // affect the original variable.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const newTeam = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = 'woo';
    console.log(team4);
    console.log(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 5 });
    console.log(cap2);
    //  ...spread is now available for objects, too!
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sam = {
      name: 'sam',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@sam',
        facebook: 'sam.sam'
      }
    }

    // this code will only make a copy of the first level of sam
    // if i then change the 'social' properties, it will change it in the original too!
    const dev = Object.assign({}, sam)

    // if you don't want to change the original, you must do a cloneDeep

    //or, a kind of hacky deep cloneDeep but might not be great performance
    // stringify will turn the object into a string to remove any references,
    // and then .parse will turn it back into an object.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sam));
    console.log(dev2);
